BitBucket Tool
Overview of the Tool
Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service, primarily for source code and development projects. It allows developers to collaborate on code, track changes, and manage their development workflows using Git or Mercurial (although Mercurial support was phased out in 2020).

Key Features
Branch Permissions: Control who can make changes to certain branches.
Pull Requests and Code Review: Streamlined pull requests with built-in code review and commenting tools.
CI/CD Integration: Built-in continuous integration and delivery through Bitbucket Pipelines.
Jira Integration: Native integration with Jira for task tracking and project management.
Code Search: Search through repositories for specific code snippets or patterns.
How It Fits into DevOps/DevSecOps
Bitbucket plays a crucial role in the DevOps pipeline by enabling code collaboration, continuous integration, and code review. It integrates well with tools like Jenkins and Kubernetes for CI/CD, and with Jira for issue tracking. Bitbucket Pipelines add automation, allowing for automated testing, deployment, and monitoring. In DevSecOps, Bitbucket can integrate security scans in pipelines to identify vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.

Parent Company of the Tool
Bitbucket is owned by Atlassian, a company known for its suite of productivity and collaboration tools like Jira, Confluence, and Trello.

Whether It Is Open Source or Paid One
Bitbucket offers both free and paid plans. Private repositories are available under the free plan with limited features, and additional functionalities are available under paid plans. It is not open source; however, it supports open-source repositories.
